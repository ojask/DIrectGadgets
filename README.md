Quite useful desktop widget app for Windows that I am creating for my college project. 
Special thanks to MishaProductions and seven-mile for DirectUI headers and static library. 
Criticism is welcomed. 

You will need to have libcurl and rapidjson installed in C:\ drive to be able to compile weather widget.
Only libcurl for news widget.
